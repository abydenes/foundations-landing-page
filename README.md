TOP Foundations landing page exercise.


In this project I will be creating a whole website from scratch. 

By completing this exercise, I will be able to:
- use flexbox confidently
- copy a website's design to some degree
- use html and support it with css

I have to say that I'm still having a hard time working with flexbox. 
I think this exercise which requires me to start from nothing, will help me understand
it a lot better.
